# Dad-Joke-Quiz-Game

To view a more indpeth explianation is displayed on [my site](https://kahwillow.squarespace.com/technical-writing/dad-joke-score). 

The purpose of this project is to create a game that will allow the user to play a game in the console that will ask them to answer three dad jokes.

By using the time.sleep() function. This function causes the code to take a brief pause. I wanted the game to display text slowly, allowing the user to 
read each line one at a time. Allowing the user to easily read each console line by line, similarly to how text was displayed in an old RPG like Final 
Fantasy on the NES. 

While the user is playing they can choose to answer the question or respond that they do not know. If the user gets the answer correcly they will be prompted 
with a compliment to keep playing. Else they are given the response. 

The last aspect of the game is if the user can guess all the correct answers they are given a bonus dad joke. Else they are told about the secret bonus and to try again.
