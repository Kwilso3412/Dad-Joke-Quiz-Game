This project is one that I took from the youtuber [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&list=WL&index=54&t=1483s)

I did two different versions 

The "Score" version 
  - asks the user for thier imput
  - gives the user a score and percentage of their results 
  - if they get it wrong they ask them to try again
  - pauses in between after text 
  
The "Try Again" version 
  - asks the user for thier imput
  - gives the user a score and percentage of their results 
  - if they get it wrong they ask them to try again
  - if they get all right they get a secret message 
  - if they get all wrong then they are prompted "better luck next time"
