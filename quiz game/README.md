This project is one that I took from the youtuber [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&list=WL&index=54&t=1483s)

if you want a full break down you can view it on [my website](https://kahwillow.com/dad-joke-score)

I added a few overall things 

- Added a response for both  yes or no 
- A response if they are unsure about the answer
- Added a pause between responses 
- A secret massage for either all correct answers/incorrect answers/partial correct answers 
- turned them into a static webpage 

I also did two different versions 

The [Score](https://kahwillow.com/dad-joke-score) version 
  -  If they answered idk to all, then they get the answer 
  -  Different message if they answer idk / incorrect to all
  -  Different message if they answer idk/ incorrect to parietal
  
The [Try Again](https://kahwillow.com/dad-joke-try-again) version 
  -  If they get it wrong, they're asked if they want to try again
  -  If they do want to try again, they are prompted again 
  -  If they don't then, they get the answer 
  -  If they are given all answers get a response, they are given a new response. 
  -  If they are given partial responses/ all try again then they are given new responses
