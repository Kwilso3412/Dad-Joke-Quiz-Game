This project is one that I took from the youtuber [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLn3jOsNRVE&list=WL&index=54&t=1483s)

I added a few overall things 

- Added a response for both  yes or no 
- A response if they are unsure about the answer
- Added a pause between responses 
- A secret massage for either all correct answers/incorrect answers/partial correct answers 
- turned them into a static webpage 

I also did two different versions 

The "Score" version 
  - If they answered idk to all then they get the answer 
  - Different message if they answer IDK to all 
  - Different message if they answer IDK to parital 
  
The "Try Again" version 
  - Asks the user for thier imput
  - Gives the user a score and percentage of their results 
  - If they get it wrong they're asked if they want to try again
  - If they do want to try again they are prompted again 
  - If they don't then they get the answer 
  - If they are given all answers get a response they are given a new response 
  - If they are given partial responses then they are given a new response
